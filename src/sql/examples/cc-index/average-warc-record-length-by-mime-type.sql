-- Update Dec 2019: add histogram counting reasons for payload truncation
-- Content payload in Common Crawl archives is truncated if the content exceeds a limit of
--  * 1 MiB in WARC files since 2013
--  * 500 kiB in the 2008 â€“ 2012 ARC files
-- The truncation is required to keep the crawl archives at a limited size and ensure
-- that a broad sample of web pages is covered. It also avoids that the archives are filled
-- by accidentally captured video or audio streams. The crawler needs to buffer the content
-- temporarily and a limit ensures that this is possible with a limited amount of RAM for
-- many parallel connections. See also
--   https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/specifications/warc-format/warc-1.1/#warc-truncated
-- The column `content_truncated` has been added in November 2019 (CC-MAIN-2019-47)
-- to the URL indexes to skip over truncated captures instantly. Here the column is used to measure
-- the impact of the truncation on various document formats (MIME types).

-- Update Mar 2023: add histogram of common file suffixes (from the path component of the URL)
